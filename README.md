<p>How To Avoid Wasting Your Most Valuable Online Asset - TIME!
If you're involved in an internet marketing business, then you've probably already come face-to-face with your #1 enemy - "Time Wasting".</p>
 
<p align = "left">What you need to know is that "Time Is Money".
And this applies even more to the online world, than in regular business.</p>

<p>You see, anyone can become an online entrepreneur.
It doesn't involve start-up capital or expensive equipment to start.
A low grade PC and a net connection is all you need.</p>

<p>And since cash isn't really a barrier, time-management has become all the more critical.
Your challenge for success is simply to get more done - in less time.</p>

<p>So what are the greatest online time wasters and what can you do to avoid them?</p>

<p><h2>Retyping the same old thing time and time again.</h2></p>

<p>This sounds simple.
But stop and think how many times you retype the same old simple information.</p>

<p>Most people have cottoned on to automating their email signature, but you can go far beyond that when it comes to communicating words quickly.</p>

<p>Get yourself a clickboard or shortcut extender.
This will enable you to write much faster and prevent you from ever having to type the same thing twice.</p>

<p>I use this utility <a href = "http://www.howtocorp.com/typepilot" target = "_blank" title = "AMOGUS">АБОБА</a>  , but there are lots of other useful typing assistant utilities available.</p>

<p><h3>Failing to manage your email effectively.</h3></p>

<p>I know, there's so much spam flying around, but you should be attempting to win this war with a few weapons of your own installed on your computer.</p>

<p>i.Make sure you have a working piece of anti-spam software set up.
Whilst sometimes the wrong messages will get trapped, the best software will still remove 98% of the emails that you don't want.
Make sure they are filtered into a junk email file, so you can manually sift through them afterwards and pull back any that have been incorrectly assumed to be unwanted.</p>

<p>ii.
Set up folders in your inbox and get yourself properly organized.
I keep a folder for SALES, another one for FEEDBACK and others for JOINT VENTURES + many more.</p>
